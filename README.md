mustached-curricula
===================

A personal webpage generator based on handlebars (a mustache superset) templates and YAML data files. Take the default template, feed it some yaml data, and voilà, you have yourself a pretty webpage, showing off the stuff you have done.

Installation
------------

You must have node.js and the npm package manager installed on your system.
After that just issue:

    make install

And you're ready to begin customizing your very own personal page.

Usage
-----

Edit the index*.yml files to your liking, with your own data. To check your work, just issue

    make

To clean every generated file, just issue

    make clean

After that you may upload the whole public folder to your website. You should customize the assets in the public folder to your own liking, since this is my personal website.
