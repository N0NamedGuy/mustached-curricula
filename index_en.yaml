            Based of the <a href="#guinot">Auto Guinot
            website</a>, I made a site for a residential called
            <i>Nosso Para&iacute;so</i>, located in the sunny Algarve.
            During my stay, I proposed the residential owners to
            build them a site. I took the Auto Guinot's code base,
            and over the week I stayed there, I made them the
            website. It is (or at least was) hosted
            at <a target="_blank" class="no-print-link"
            href="http://www.residencialnossoparaiso.com">

            A website I made on my free time for an auto stand.

            www.autoguinot.pt</a>, but the stand owners stopped caring for the
            website, so the website is down at the moment.
